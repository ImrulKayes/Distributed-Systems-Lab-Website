<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="prometheus"></a> Prometheus: User-Controlled P2P Social Data Management for Socially-Aware Applications
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Recent Internet applications, such as online social networks and user-generated content sharing, produce an unprecedented amount of social information, which is further augmented by location or collocation data collected from mobile phones. Unfortunately, this wealth of social information is fragmented across many different proprietary applications. Combined, it could provide a more accurate representation of the social world, and it could enable a whole new set of socially-aware applications. We introduce Prometheus, a peer-to-peer service that collects and manages social information from multiple sources and implements a set of social inference functions while enforcing user-defined access control policies. Prometheus is socially-aware: it allows users to select peers that manage their social information based on social trust and exploits naturally-formed social groups for improved performance. We tested our Prometheus prototype on PlanetLab and built a mobile social application to test the performance of its social inference functions under real-time constraints. We showed that the social-based mapping of users onto peers improves the service response time and high service availability is achieved with low overhead.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="gdc"></a>GDC: Group Discovery using Co-location Traces
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Smart phones can collect and share Bluetooth co-location traces to identify ad hoc or semi-permanent social groups. This information, known to group members but otherwise unavailable, can be leveraged in applications and protocols, such as recommender systems or delay-tolerant forwarding in ad hoc networks, to enhance the user experience. Group discovery using Bluetooth co-location is practical because: (i) Bluetooth is embedded in nearly every phone and has low battery consumption, (ii) the short wireless transmission range can lead to good group identification accuracy, and (iii) privacy-conscious users are more likely to share co-location data than absolute location data.
This paper proposes the Group Discovery using Co-location traces (GDC) algorithm, which leverages user meeting frequency and duration to accurately detect groups. GDC is validated on one month of data collected from 141 smart phones carried by students on our campus. Users rated GDC's groups 30% better than groups discovered using the K-Clique algorithm. Additionally, GDC lends itself more easily to a distributed implementation, which achieves similar results with the centralized version while improving user's privacy.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="affinity"></a> Affinity P2P: A self-organizing content-based locality-aware collaborative peer-to-peer network 
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The last years have brought a dramatic increase in the popularity of collaborative Web 2.0 sites. According to recent evaluations, this phenomenon accounts for a large share of Internet traffic and significantly augments the load on the end-servers of Web 2.0 sites. In this paper, we show how collaborative classifications extracted from Web 2.0-like sites can be leveraged in the design of a self-organizing peer-to-peer network in order to distribute data in a scalable manner while preserving a high-content locality. We propose Affinity P2P (AP2P), a novel cluster-based locality-aware self-organizing peer-to-peer network. AP2P self-organizes in order to improve content locality using a novel affinity-based metric for estimating the distance between clusters of nodes sharing similar content. Searches in AP2P are directed to the cluster of interests, where a logarithmic-time parallel flooding algorithm provides high recall, low latency, and low communication overhead. The order of clusters is periodically changed using a greedy cluster placement algorithm, which reorganizes clusters based on affinity in order to increase the locality of related content. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate that the locality-aware cluster-based organization of content offers substantial benefits, achieving an average latency improvement of 45%, and up to 12% increase in search recall.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="geos"></a> On Managing Social Data for Enabling Socially-Aware Applications and Services
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Applications and services that take advantage of social data usually infer social relationships using information produced only within their own context. We propose to combine social information from multiple sources into a directed and weighted social multigraph in order to enable novel socially-aware applications and services. We present GeoS, our early prototype of a geo-social data management service which implements a representative set of social inferences. We demonstrate GeoS' potential for social applications on a collection of social data that combines collocation information and Facebook friendship declarations from 100 students. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="smallworld"></a> The Small World of File Sharing
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Web caches, content distribution networks, peer-to-peer file sharing networks, distributed file systems, and data grids all have in common that they involve a community of users who use shared data. In each case, overall system performance can be improved significantly by first identifying and then exploiting the structure of community's data access patterns.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">We propose a novel perspective for analyzing data access workloads that considers the implicit relationships that form among users based on the data they access. We propose a new structure&#151;the interest-sharing graph&#151;that captures common user interests in data and justify its utility with studies on four data-sharing systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, the Kazaa peer-to-peer network, and a BitTorrent file-sharing community. We find small-world patterns in the interest-sharing graphs of all four communities. We investigate analytically and experimentally some of the potential causes that lead to this pattern and conclude that user preferences play a major role.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The significance of small-world patterns is two-fold: it provides a rigorous support to intuition and it suggests the potential to exploit these naturally emerging patterns. As a proof of concept, we design and evaluate an information dissemination system that exploits the small-world interest-sharing graphs by building an interest-aware network overlay. We show that this approach leads to improved information dissemination performance. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="lopsil"></a>LoPSiL: A Location-based Policy-specification Language
<p class="paragraph_style_1">This paper describes the design of LoPSiL, a language for specifying location-dependent security and privacy policies. Policy- specification languages like LoPSiL are domain-specific programming languages intended to simplify the tasks of specifying and enforcing sound security policies on untrusted (i.e., potentially insecure) software. As far as we are aware, LoPSiL is the first imperative policy-specification language to provide abstractions specifically tailored to location-dependent policies for mobile-device applications. We have implemented a proof-of-concept compiler that inputs a LoPSiL policy P and a mobile-device application program A and outputs a new application program A equivalent to A, except that A contains inlined enforcement code that ensures that A satisfies P at runtime. We report our experiences using this compiler to design and implement several policies for mobile-device applications. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="tagging"></a> Individual and Social Behavior in Tagging Systems
<p class="paragraph_style_1">In tagging systems users can annotate items of interest with free-form terms. A good understanding of the usage characteristics of such systems is necessary to improve the design of current and next generation tagging systems. To this end, this work explores three aspects of user behavior in CiteULike and Connotea, two systems that include tagging features to support online personalized management of scientific publications. First, this study characterizes the degree to which users re-tag previously published items and reuse tags: 10 to 20% of the daily activity can be characterized as re-tagging and about 75% of the activity as tag reuse. Second, we use the pairwise similarity between users' activity to characterize the interest sharing in these systems. We present the interest sharing distribution across the systems, show that this metric encodes information about existing usage patterns, and attempt to correlate interest sharing levels to indicators of collaboration such as co-membership in discussion groups and semantic similarity of tag vocabularies. Finally, we show that interest sharing leads to an implicit structure that exhibits a natural segmentation. Throughout the paper we discuss the potential impact of our findings on the design of mechanisms that support tagging systems. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="resource"></a> Workload characterization in a high-energy data grid and impact on resource management
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The analysis of data usage in a large set of real traces from a high-energy physics collaboration revealed the existence of an emergent grouping of files that we coined "filecules". This paper presents the benefits of using this file grouping for prestaging data and compares it with previously proposed file grouping techniques along a range of performance metrics. Our experiments with real workloads demonstrate that filecule grouping is a reliable and useful abstraction for data management in science Grids; that preserving time locality for data prestaging is highly recommended; that job reordering with respect to data availability has significant impact on throughput; and finally, that a relatively short history of traces is a good predictor for filecule grouping. Our experimental results provide lessons for workload modeling and suggest design guidelines for data management in data-intensive resource-sharing environments.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="music"></a> Beyond Music Sharing: An Evaluation of Peer-to-Peer Data Dissemination Techniques in Large Scientific Collaborations
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The avalanche of data from scientific instruments and the ensuing interest from geographically distributed users to analyze and interpret it accentuates the need for efficient data dissemination. A suitable data distribution scheme will find the delicate balance between conflicting requirements of minimizing transfer times, minimizing the impact on the network, and uniformly distributing load among participants. We identify several data distribution techniques, some successfully employed by today's peer-to-peer networks: staging, data partitioning, orthogonal bandwidth exploitation, and combinations of the above. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="socapps"></a> P2P Systems Meet Mobile Computing: A Community-Oriented Software Infrastructure for Mobile Social Applications
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The widespread adoption of powerful mobile devices creates an unprecedented potential for innovative mobile applications that can enhance users' social interactions. The current centralized mobile system and service architectures do not allow large-scale dynamic interactions between mobile devices, as required by these applications. This paper proposes Mobius, a decentralized solution that supports mobile social applications via a two-tier software infrastructure. In Mobius, a socially-aware peer-to-peer tier provides community-oriented data and persistent services for the mobile tier that runs the applications. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="file"></a> File Grouping for Scientific Data Management: Lessons from Experimenting with Real Traces
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The analysis of data usage in a large set of real traces from a high-energy physics collaboration revealed the existence of an emergent grouping of files that we coined "filecules".

<p class="paragraph_style_1">Our experimental results provide lessons for workload modeling and suggest design guidelines for data management in data-intensive resource-sharing environments.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="s3"></a> Amazon S3 for Science Grids: a Viable Solution?
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Amazon.com has introduced the Simple Storage Service (S3), a commodity-priced storage utility. S3 aims to provide storage as a low-cost, highly available service, with a simple 'pay-as-you-go' charging model. This article makes three contributions. First, we evaluate S3's ability to provide storage support to large-scale science projects from a cost, availability, and performance perspective. Second, we identify a set of additional functionalities that storage services targeting data-intensive science applications should support. Third, we propose unbundling the success metrics for storage utility performance as a solution, to reduce storage costs. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="grid"></a> Data Transfers in the Grid: Workload Analysis of Globus GridFTP
<p class="paragraph_style_1">One of the basic services in grids is the transfer of data between remote machines. Files may be transferred at the explicit request of the user or as part of delegated resource management services, such as data replication or job scheduling. GridFTP is an important tool for such data transfers since it builds on the common FTP protocol, has a large user base with multiple implementations, and it uses the GSI security model that allows delegated operations.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">This paper presents a workload analysis of the implementation of the GridFTP protocol provided by the Globus Toolkit. We studied more than 1.5 years of traces reported from all over the world by Globus GridFTP installed components. Our study focuses on three dimensions: first, it quantifies the volume of data transferred and characterizes user behavior. Second, it attempts to show how tuning capabilities are used in practice. Finally, it quantifies the user base as recorded in the database and highlights the usage trends of this software component. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="content"></a> Content Reuse and Interest Sharing in Tagging Communities
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Tagging communities represent a subclass of a broader class of user-generated content-sharing online communities. In such communities users introduce and tag content for later use. Although recent studies advocate and attempt to harness social knowledge in this context by exploiting collaboration among users, little research has been done to quantify the current level of user collaboration in these communities. This paper introduces two metrics to quantify the level of collaboration: content reuse and shared interest. Using these two metrics, this paper shows that the current level of collaboration in CiteULike and Connotea is consistently low, which significantly limits the potential of harnessing the social knowledge in communities. This study also discusses implications of these findings in the context of recommendation and reputation systems.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="globus"></a> The Globus Replica Location Service: Design and Experience
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Distributed computing systems employ replication to improve overall system robustness, scalability and performance. A Replica Location Service (RLS) offers a mechanism to maintain and provide information about physical locations of replicas. This paper defines a design framework for replica location services that supports a variety of deployment options. We describe the RLS implementation that is distributed with the Globus Toolkit and is in production use in several Grid deployments. Features of our modular implementation include the use of soft-state protocols to populate a distributed index and Bloom filter compression to reduce overheads for distribution of index information. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that the RLS implementation scales well for individual servers with millions of entries and up to one hundred clients. We describe the characteristics of existing RLS deployments and discuss how RLS has been integrated with higher-level data management services. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="simplicity"></a> In Search of Simplicity: A Self-Organizing Group Communication Overlay
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Group communication primitives have broad utility as building blocks for distributed applications. The challenge is to create and maintain the distributed structures that support these primitives while accounting for volatile end-nodes and variable network characteristics. Most solutions proposed to date rely on complex algorithms or global information, thus limiting the scale of deployments and acceptance outside the academic realm.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">This article introduces a low-complexity, self-organizing solution for maintaining multicast trees, that we refer to as UMM (Unstructured Multi-source Multicast). UMM uses traditional distributed systems techniques: layering, soft-state, and passive data collection to adapt to the dynamics of the physical network and maintain data dissemination trees. The result is a simple, adaptive system with lower overheads than more complex alternatives. We have implemented UMM and evaluated it on up to 1024-node emulated ModelNet networks and on the PlanetLab testbed. Extensive experimental evaluations and quantitative comparisons with alternative solutions demonstrate UMM's low overhead, efficient network usage, and ability to quickly adapt to network changes and to recover from failures. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="tracking"></a> Tracking Usage in Collaborative Tagging Communities
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (i.e., tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to increased content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target the management of scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The properties of the structure we uncover suggest a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that suggest that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content retrieval and navigation as communities scale. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="science"></a> Are P2P Data-Dissemination Techniques Viable in Today's Data-Intensive Scientific Collaborations?
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The interest among a geographically distributed user base to mine massive collections of scientific data propels the need for efficient data dissemination solutions. An optimal data distribution scheme will find the delicate and often application-specific balance among conflicting success metrics such as minimizing transfer times, minimizing the impact on the network, and uniformly distributing load among participants. We use simulations to explore the performance of main classes of data-distribution techniques, some of the successfully deployed by large peer-to-peer communities, in the context of today's data-centric scientific collaborations. Based on these simulations we derive several recommendations for data distribution in real-world science collaborations. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="doctrine"></a> Toward a Doctrine of Containment: Grid Hosting with Adaptive Resource
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Grid computing environments need secure resource control and predictable service quality in order to be sustainable. We propose a grid hosting model in which independent, self-contained grid deployments run within isolated containers on shared resource provider sites. Sites and hosted grids interact via an underlying resource control plane to manage a dynamic binding of computational resources to containers. We present a prototype grid hosting system, in which a set of independent Globus grids share a network of cluster sites. Each grid instance runs a coordinator that leases and configures cluster resources for its grid on demand. Experiments demonstrate adaptive provisioning of cluster resources and contrast job-level and container-level resource management in the context of two grid application managers.
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="filecules"></a> Filecules in High-Energy Physics: Characteristics and Impact on Resource Management
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Grid computing has reached the stage where deployments are mature and many collaborations run in production mode. Mature Grid deployments offer the opportunity for revisiting and perhaps updating traditional beliefs related to workload models, which in turn leads to the reevaluation of traditional resource management techniques. 
<p class="paragraph_style_1">This paper analyzes usage patterns in a typical Grid community, a large-scale data-intensive scientific collaboration in high-energy physics. We focus mainly on data usage, since data is the major resource for this class of applications. Our observations led us to propose a new abstraction for resource management in scientific data analysis applications: we define a filecule as a group of files that is always used together. We show that filecules exist and present their characteristics. The existence of filecules suggests a new granularity for data management, which, if incorporated in design, can significantly outperform the traditional solutions for data caching, replication and placement based on single-file granularity. We reason about the impact of filecules on resource management and show compelling evidence for using this abstraction when designing data management services. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="s4"</a> S4: A Simple Storage Service for Sciences
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage utility that bundles at a single pricing point three storage system characteristics: high data durability, high availability, and high-speed data access. Many applications, and scientific applications in particular, do not need all these three characteristics bundled together. We argue that unbundling offers an opportunity to provide acceptably-priced storage and that future storage utilities designed to support science communities can offer multiple classes of service without introducing hidden, complexity-related costs. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="anderson"></a>GeoS: A Service for the Management of Geo-Social Information in a Distributed System
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Applications and services that take advantage of social data usually infer social relationships using information produced only within their own context, using a greatly simplified representation of users' social data. We propose to combine social information from multiple sources into a directed and weighted social multigraph in order to enable novel socially-aware applications and services. We present GeoS, a geo-social data management service which implements a representative set of social inferences and can run on a decentralized system. We demonstrate GeoS' potential for social applications on a collection of social data that combines collocation information and Facebook friendship declarations from 100 students. We demonstrate its performance by testing it both on PlanetLab and a LAN with a realistic workload for a 1000 node graph. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="stillo"></a>Tango Panopticon: Developing a Platform for Supporting Live Synchronous Art Events Based in Relational Aesthetics
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The Tango Panopticon project merges art with technology to create a live and synchronous art experience which is just as much about the participants as it is about the observers. The goal of this project is to create a dialogue between observers of the event in the hopes of creating new social connections where there were none before. This goal is achieved by allowing observers to view the event from anywhere around the world on a computer via the internet and participate in a dialogue with other users on the website. 
<p class="paragraph_style_1">The other objective of this project is to create a multimedia internet platform for other art projects to use. Other artists that are interested in hosting their own live synchronous event will be able to use the platform we have created and customize it to the specific needs of their project. 
<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="doraimani"></a> Filecules: A New Granularity for Resource Management in Grids
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Grids provide an infrastructure for seamless, secure access to a globally distributed set of shared computing resources. Grid computing has reached the stage where deployments are run in production mode. In the most active Grid community, the scientific community, jobs are data and compute intensive. Scientific Grid deployments offer the opportunity for revisiting and perhaps updating traditional beliefs related to workload models and hence reevaluate traditional resource management techniques.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">In this thesis, we study usage patterns from a large-scale scientific Grid collaboration in high-energy physics. We focus mainly on data usage, since data is the major resource for this class of applications. We perform a detailed workload characterization which led us to propose a new data abstraction, filecule, that groups correlated files. We characterize filecules and show that they are an appropriate data granularity for resource management. 
<p class="paragraph_style_1">In scientific applications, job scheduling and data staging are tightly coupled. The only algorithm previously proposed for this class of applications, Greedy Request Value (GRV), uses a function that assigns a relative value to a job. We wrote a cache simulator that uses the same technique of combining cache replacement with job reordering to evaluate and compare quantitatively a set of alternative solutions. These solutions are combinations of Least Recently Used (LRU) and GRV from the cache replacement space with First-Come First-Served (FCFS) and the GRV-specific job reordering from the scheduling space. Using real workload from the DZero Experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, we measure and compare performance based on byte hit rate, cache change, job waiting time, job waiting queue length, and scheduling overhead.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">Based on our experimental investigations, we propose a new technique that combines LRU for cache replacement and job scheduling based on the relative request value. This technique incurs less data transfer costs than the GRV algorithm and shorter job processing delays than FCFS. We also propose using filecules for data management to further improve the results obtained from the above LRU and GRV combination.
<p class="paragraph_style_1">We show that filecules can be identified in practical situations and demonstrate how the accuracy of filecule identification influences caching performance.
