<p class="paragraph_style_1"> Collective intelligence has been harnessed recently to create new collaborative forms that were not previously achievable. This socially-emergent intelligence appears in collaborative management and indexing of information, authoring encyclopedia articles, participating in blogs, tagging or commenting photographs or videos. This socially-emergent movement also exposes an unprecedented amount of social information. Particularly, two classes of Internet applications reveal voluminous social information: popular online social networks (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn); and the widely-adopted collaborative tools (e.g., CiteULike or Delicious) that provide rich information fabric through tags, annotations, and text organization.
<p class="paragraph_style_1"> This project investigates the potential of including social knowledge in the design of community-enabled peer-to-peer distributed infrastructures. We will design, prototype, and evaluate a community-oriented peer-to-peer infrastructure that exploits social knowledge for services such as data and computing management, while protecting social data privacy seen as contextual integrity. Using social knowledge in the design of services will likely improve performance, based on the assumptions that: social incentives reduce churn; socially-inferred trust reduce security breaches and expand the set of available resources; and shared interest improves data placement decisions or co-location of data and computations. This will create the potential to enable new classes of applications and infrastructures.

<p class="paragraph_style_1"> This project aims to explore the benefits of embedding social knowledge in the network protocols and services that support mobile social computing applications. To this end, we will investigate, design, and prototype Mobius, a self-organizing, self-adaptive, community-oriented, multi-tier network infrastructure for mobile social computing. Similar to the Mobius band that has one surface despite the appearance of two, this infrastructure consists of two tiers that converge into one network: (1) a Mobile (wireless) human-centric tier, which runs mobile applications and collects geo-social context information, and (2) a Peer-to-Peer (wired) system tier, which runs services in support of mobile applications and adapts to the geo-social context to enable energy-efficient, scalable, secure, and reliable mobile applications. Similar to traditional Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, users will contribute their resources, both wireless mobile devices and wired PCs, to create this infrastructure. Unlike existing mobile service provisioning solutions, Mobius is decentralized, adaptive, and flexible. As a necessary departure from the dependence of mobile applications on cellular network operators, it allows mobile applications on the phones (i.e., in the Mobile tier) to interact with user-deployed mobile services in the P2P tier. This independence is achieved using community-supported services running on a collection of user-owned resources in a P2P manner. Our architecture does not preclude existing or new services offered by network providers or third parties. [<a href="mobius/index.html">more</a>]

<p class="paragraph_style"><a name="tango"></a> Tango Panopticon (funded by USF Colleges of Engineering and of The Arts)
<p class="paragraph_style_1"> Hundreds of Argentine tango dancers danced on May 1, 2010 in front of surveillance cameras in a worldwide synchronous public art event of unprecedented scale. The public at each location was invited to participate by streaming live video from mobile phones, connecting the participants in a live, virtual global dance party.
<p class="paragraph_style_1"> This project combined Professor Lawrence's art interventions, which involve unexpected dancing by large groups of people in public spaces, with our research in socially-aware support for mobile applications. Tango Panopticon unfolded simultaneously before thousands of people on an international scale and via the Internet to many thousands more. The innovative technical aspects proposed were not merely intended for the sake of attention grabbing spectacle. The mobile technologies developed and distributed to the public, and the manner of their use for this work created a completely unique aesthetic experience, engaging in innovative ways such critical contemporary art themes as telepresence, rhizomal networks, and real/virtual hybridity. Putting these elements into play within a vast international interactive social meditation on the critical issues regarding public surveillance constituted a significant innovation in contemporary art.
